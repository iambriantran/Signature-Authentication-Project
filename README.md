# Signature Authentication Project

This project involves the development and evaluation of various machine learning models to authenticate signatures. The focus of the project is to compare different classification models and determine their effectiveness in signature recognition and authentication.

## Project Files

- **[FINAL REPORT - DS - GROUP 2.pdf](FINAL REPORT - DS - GROUP 2.pdf)**: A comprehensive report that outlines the methodology, results, and findings from the signature authentication project.
- **[ML Model Training - KNN, RF, NN.ipynb](ML Model Training - KNN, RF, NN.ipynb)**: This notebook includes the training and evaluation of three machine learning models: 
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Neural Networks (NN)
  
  Each model is trained on a dataset of signature images to assess its accuracy in authentication tasks.
  
- **[CNN_Training_Model.ipynb](CNN_Training_Model.ipynb)**: This notebook focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for signature authentication. CNNs are widely used in image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically detect features from raw image data.

## Overview

The goal of the Signature Authentication Project is to explore different approaches for verifying signatures using machine learning. We compare traditional models (KNN, RF) with advanced neural networks (CNN, NN) to determine which method is most effective at identifying authentic signatures and preventing forgeries.

### Key Objectives:

- Preprocessing signature data for model training.
- Implementing machine learning models (KNN, RF, NN) for signature classification.
- Exploring the effectiveness of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in handling image-based signature data.
- Comparing model performance based on accuracy and precision.

## Conclusion

By implementing a variety of machine learning models, this project provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in signature authentication. Our final report summarizes the findings and provides a clear comparison between traditional and neural network methods.
